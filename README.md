# V/STOL UAS Size and Performance Dataset

This repostiory contains a database of mass properties and performance characteristics of nearly two hundred vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) vehicles that appears in the reference below. Characteristics of the uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) recorded include maximum gross takeoff weight, endurance,  size, speed, payload, and payload fraction. 

The data is provided in the form of a comma seperated value (.CSV) file contained herein (*dataset.csv*) along with a MATLAB script (*main.m*) that generates relevant scatter plots and statistics.
